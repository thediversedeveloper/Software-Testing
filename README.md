# Software-Testing

#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure this by creating, and running proper testing in my code. I can make tests against each class, and I can write comments in my code to describe what I am doing to someone who is reading my program. 

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I understand and learn the users needs, and then incorporate them into the programs requirements. Then by creating and employing tests against the code to verify it is working properly in all aspects. This may require several different tests. 

#How do I approach designing software?
I would review the clients needs, and then the users. I would mock up software using UML Diagram against the software requirements, and then employ coing and testing against the code written.

# Software-Testing

#How can I ensure at my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensuring that your code, program, or software is both functional and secure involves a combination process of practice, tools, and methodologies. Before coding, conducting a design review to ensure that the architecture is both secure and scalable. Write and conduct unit tests for components to verify functionality. Perform multiple security testing to meet functional requirements, such as static analysis. Methodologies used for best secure coding practices, following secure coding guidelines and best practices. Avoding common security pitfalls, and using parameterized queries for database interactions. Last but not least, keeping well maintained, and detailed documentation. 

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program is imperative to developing softwware that meets user needs. Starting wiht engaging with users, actively communicating with users to understand their requirements. Developing user personas for different types of users. Defiining use cases to describe desired functionality. Prioritize requirements, and use agile development proccesses. Having prototyping, and then creating UI/UX Design, and finally user acceptance testing to involve users in the process to meet user requirements. Always maintaing in the future. 

#How do I approach designing software?

Designing software involves both creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills. When I approach designing software I would start with undestanding all the requirements of the software, incuding stakeholders, and end-users. This would help define goals, and identify users, and use cases. Then I would research, and analyze existing constraints, dependancies, and technical considerations. After finding out the architecture of the design I would start the UI, and Database design. Prototyping, and fixing feedback I would then conduct a UAT test and then continous evaluation and improvement once finished.
